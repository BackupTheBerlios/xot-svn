This is xot, a database description framework.

That is, its main purpose is to allow developers to describe databases in a
a common language (in xot language) and then generate usefull things from it,
like sql scripts for database creation, database documentation or some graphs.

The xot language is simply xml. You can see the xot.dtd to learn about it.

There's a couple of examples in the `example' directory.

To install, just edit the Makefile, adjust the PREFIX at will and `make
install'.

There's not much documentation right now. Try `exotic --help'. Any doubts,
please email to papo-hackers@nongnu.org
